The Bloomington scholars, once they delineated the broader parameters of their own research program, started to reconstruct, reinterpret, and in many cases simply rediscover and reinvent Austrian insights and themes. As such, they created the possibility of giving those insights and themes new interpretations and new applications, in novel circumstances with new research priorities, in particular, public administration, governance and collective action, and entrepreneurship in non-market settings. Was there a programmatic and explicit effort to recover and reinvent the Austrian tradition? The answer has to be an emphatic 'no'. But that is precisely the reason why the Ostroms' work should be interesting to scholars working in the Austrian tradition. The thematic convergence and the compatibility and complementarity between the Austrian and Bloomington schools is driven by their internal underlying theoretical logic and by the logic of problem solving. Upon closer inspection, the underlying familial and genealogical connections reveal themselves again and again. The convergence and interplay between these two intellectual traditions is rich and productive. On the one hand, it stands as a demonstration of the applied relevance of the set of approaches and issues that we traditionally associate with the Austrian tradition. On the other hand, it is a challenge to further explore and elaborate this area. This volume is an attempt to respond to that challenge. 0aEconomicszAustria. 0aEconomicsxSociological aspects.1 aAligică, Paul Dragoș,eeditor.1 aLewis, Paul,d1971-eeditor.1 aStorr, Virgil Henry,d1975-eeditor. 0aAdvances in Austrian economics ;vvol. 22.40uhttp://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/book/10.1108/S1529-213420172202340nam a2200397Ii 45000010014000000030008000140050017000220060019000390070015000580080041000730200028001140400031001420500023001730720016001960720023002120800010002350820018002452450106002632640056003692640011004253000039004363360026004753370026005013380036005274900073005635000020006365040041006565050180006975200787008776500039016646500029017037000035017327000034017678300073018018560068018749781787430693UtOrBLW20171115094539.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||171115t20172018enk     ob    001 0 eng d  a9781787430693q(e-book)  aUtOrBLWbengerdacUtOrBLW 4aHD30.27b.A33 2017 7aKCJ2bicssc 7aBUS0860002bisacsh  a330.104a658.4035522300aAdvances in Business and Management Forecasting.nVol. 12 /cKenneth D.

Recent estimates suggest that millions of people across the world are involved in some form of social venture creation.  After over a decade of thoughtful scholarship on social entrepreneurship, researchers have now begun to examine individuals and organizations that purposefully combine social and economic outcomes. In Hybrid Ventures, leading researchers examine individuals and organizations that simultaneously attempt to pursue such bended value outcomes. Various perspectives on hybrid ventures are explored in this volume, including: the costs to all when some entrepreneurs do not pursue hybrid approaches, whether hybrid ventures are  -  or should be  -  the new norm, and whether the social, environmental, and economic value are distinct and should be separated from each other.  This volume contains both theoretical and empirical approaches to hybrid venturing from an international group of researchers. Specific topics include: the emergence of Certified B Corporations, different hybrid business models, the role of impact investing, indigenous entrepreneurship, hybrid ventures as "agents of change," and more. For nearly two decades, the Advances in Entrepreneurship, Firm Emergence and Growth series has provided an annual examination of the major current research, efforts in the field of entrepreneurship and Hybrid Ventures: Perspectives & Approaches to Blended Value Entrepreneurship continue in that tradition.  This volume provides state-of-the-art research that helps set the foundation for inquiries into important research for the next decade and beyond.  0aSocial entrepreneurship.1 aCorbett, Andrew C.,eeditor.1 aKatz, Jerome A.,eeditor. 0aAdvances in entrepreneurship, firm emergence and growth ;vv.19.x1074-754040uhttp://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/book/10.1108/S1074-754020171902593nam a2200373Ii 45000010014000000030008000140050017000220060019000390070015000580080041000730200028001140400031001420500022001730720016001950720023002110800008002340820020002422450084002622640056003462640011004023000040004133360026004533370026004793380036005054900051005415000020005925040041006125201408006536500021020616500021020826500022021037000026021258560068021519781787431119UtOrBLW20171115094539.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||171115t20172018enk     ob    001 0 eng d  a9781787431119q(e-book)  aUtOrBLWbengerdacUtOrBLW 4aZ675.V7bR87 2017 7aGLM2bicssc 7aLAN0250002bisacsh  a02704a016.027443722300aRural and small public libraries :bchallenges and opportunities /cBrian Real. 1aBingley, U.K. :bEmerald Publishing Limited,c2017. 4c©2018  a1 online resource (xvi, 223 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier0 aAdvances in librarianship,x0065-2830 ;vv. 43  aIncludes index.  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aRural and small public libraries provide invaluable services to their communities. These information institutions operate in areas that, when compared to national averages, have poor broadband accessibility and weaker connection speeds, low home internet adoption rates, higher unemployment rates, and less per capita access to doctors and other healthcare providers. Public libraries help to bridge these divides and help to mitigate the impact of these geographic and socioeconomic disadvantages. However, librarians are only able to do so much when they are funded by limited, primarily local revenues and are not able to achieve economies of scale that come with larger service population bases. Thus, this volume begins by defining the challenges that rural and small libraries face before shifting to an analysis of ways that these obstacles can be overcome or mitigated. Building off of this foundation, the authors explore ideas for enhancing community partnerships and outreach, using rural and small public libraries as centers for local cultural heritage activities, and training rural public librarians to better serve their publics. The authors of this volume bridge the gap between academic research and practical application, creating a volume that will allow rural librarians, trustees, and their allies to argue for greater support and enact change to benefit their service communities. 0aRural libraries. 0aSmall libraries. 0aPublic libraries.1 aReal, Brian,eeditor.40uhttp://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/book/10.1108/S0065-283020174302421nam a2200385Ii 45000010014000000030008000140050017000220060019000390070015000580080041000730200028001140400031001420500024001730720016001970720023002130800008002360820015002442450100002592640056003592640011004153000041004263360026004673370026004933380036005194900054005555000020006095040041006295201099006706500033017696500026018026500044018287000042018728300053019148560068019679781787146235UtOrBLW20171115094539.0m     o  d        cr un|||||||||171115t20172018enk     ob    001 0 eng d  a9781787146235q(e-book)  aUtOrBLWbengerdacUtOrBLW 4aHQ1063.5b.T73 2017 7aRPT2bicssc 7aTRA0090002bisacsh  a65604a362.6322300aTransport, travel and later life /cCharles Musselwhite (College of Human and Health Sciences). 1aBingley, U.K. :bEmerald Publishing Limited,c2017. 4c©2018  a1 online resource (xxiv, 224 pages).  atextbtxt2rdacontent  acomputerbc2rdamedia  aonline resourcebcr2rdacarrier1 aTransport and sustainability,x2044-9941 ;vv. 10  aIncludes index.  aIncludes bibliographical references.  aThis book, set within a social gerontology and transport behaviour studies paradigm, examines current debates and issues around transport for older people and its relationship to health and wellbeing for individuals and society as a whole. This timely title explores transport and travel needs and motivations of older people, barriers older people face using public and community transport, difficulties in accessing public spaces for walking and cycling. The safety of older drivers and recent advances in technology are also investigated. Concluding by looking to the future in addressing digital cities, driverless cars and other changes in ICT that may affect older people and their travel behaviour, a variety of global perspectives examine the social aspects of mobility and transport from a psychological, sociological, and geographical perspective. This title will be of interest to those working with older people in the health and wellbeing sector, those involved in transport and town and country planning and academics examining gerontology and associated social science subjects.  0aOlder peoplexTranportation. 0aOlder peoplexTravel. 0aTransportationxTechnological advances.1 aMusselwhite, Charles,d1975-eeditor. 0aTransport and sustainability ;vv.10.x2044-994140uhttp://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/book/10.1108/S2044-9941201710
